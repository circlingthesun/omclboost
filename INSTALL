In order to build the OMCLPBoost package, you need to install these libraries:

* Eigen3: C++ template library for linear algebra
  http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

* CMake

After installing the dependencies, run the following from the project root:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This should build the "OMCLPBoost" binary.
